War Rules:
//--The Deal--
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.
    //Declare user and declare computer
    //Create cards using an array
    // mark array as a matrix?
//--The Play--
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up one card face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.

//--How to Keep Score--
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
***/

// 2 player game
    // Declare computer program as secondary player
    // Separate for 
// divide 52 cards between the players
    // use a base array and pointers to direct the cards from the base to the computer and player
    // 26 cards for player and 26 cards for computer
    // using void, rand, and srand
// top card on each deck revealed by each player
    // create a comparative/equivalency function to determine output and loop the game under the computer's array is empty
    // the array should be empty to delcare the opposing winner 
// Highest number wins collecting all the cards
    // 
// Game goes until one player has all the cards
    // computer array or player array should be empty to declare the opponent the winner

Building a prototype
***/

// base prototype focuses on numbers 1-52 
// Seperate 26 numbers between the computer and the player 

// base array containing all numbers
// randomly seperate 26 numbers between the computer array and player array
// use rand and srand for absolute randomness
//isolate the number for them to be them selves
