WAR Pseudo Code
***/

// 2 player game
    // Declare computer program as secondary player
    // Separate for 
// divide 52 cards between the players
    // use a base array and pointers to direct the cards from the base to the computer and player
    // 26 cards for player and 26 cards for computer
    // using void, rand, and srand
// top card on each deck revealed by each player
    // create a comparative/equivalency function to determine output and loop the game under the computer's array is empty
    // the array should be empty to delcare the opposing winner 
// Highest number wins collecting all the cards
    // 
// Game goes until one player has all the cards
    // computer array or player array should be empty to declare the opponent the winner

Building a prototype
***/

// base prototype focuses on numbers 1-52 
// Seperate 26 numbers between the computer and the player 

// base array containing all numbers
// randomly seperate 26 numbers between the computer array and player array
// use rand and srand for absolute randomness
//isolate the number for them to be them selves
